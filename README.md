Hi, my real name is José Gabriel Benites Medina, at the time of writting this README, I'm 16 years old. Currently, I'm learning Python and C.
My interest in programming started not so long ago. I've always liked videogames, and since I was a kid I dreamed of being part of the development of a videogame, for that, I've decided to get into the world of programming.
